# Business Database Management Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack business database management application built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. The application enables users to manage business contacts with comprehensive features including Excel import/export, advanced search and filtering, tagging capabilities, and a modern UI built with shadcn/ui components. The system follows a clean separation between client and server code, with shared TypeScript schemas for type safety across the stack.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server, providing fast HMR and optimized production builds
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

**UI Component System**
- shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled components
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- Material Design 3 inspired design system with Linear/Notion aesthetics
- Custom theme system supporting light/dark modes via context provider
- Typography: Inter font for UI, JetBrains Mono for monospace data fields

**State Management**
- TanStack React Query for server state management, caching, and API synchronization
- Local component state with React hooks for UI state
- No global state management library - queries handle data fetching and caching

**Data Display**
- TanStack React Table for advanced table features (sorting, filtering, selection)
- Custom components for search, filtering (tags, zipcodes), and data manipulation
- Excel import/export functionality using xlsx library

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**
- Express.js running on Node.js with TypeScript
- ESM modules throughout the codebase
- Development mode uses tsx for direct TypeScript execution
- Production builds use esbuild for fast bundling

**API Design**
- RESTful API endpoints under `/api` prefix
- CRUD operations for business entities
- Bulk operations support for Excel import
- File upload handling via multer middleware
- Centralized error handling middleware

**Data Layer**
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries and schema management
- PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless) as the primary database
- WebSocket connection pooling for serverless database access
- Schema-first approach with Zod validation for runtime type checking

**Development Tools**
- Separate development and production configurations
- Request logging middleware for API debugging
- Vite integration in development for seamless full-stack development

### Database Architecture

**Schema Design**
- Single `businesses` table with the following structure:
  - UUID primary key (generated by database)
  - Required fields: name, streetName, zipcode, city, country, email
  - Optional fields: phone, comment
  - Array field for tags (PostgreSQL text array)
  - Boolean flag for active/inactive status
  
**Migration Strategy**
- Drizzle Kit for schema migrations
- Schema definitions in shared directory for client/server consistency
- Push-based migrations for development (`db:push` script)

**Data Validation**
- Zod schemas generated from Drizzle tables
- Runtime validation on API requests
- Type inference for TypeScript interfaces

### External Dependencies

**Database Service**
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL with WebSocket support
- Connection pooling via `@neondatabase/serverless`
- Environment-based configuration via `DATABASE_URL`

**UI Component Library**
- Radix UI for accessible, unstyled primitives (dialogs, dropdowns, popovers, etc.)
- Full suite of components including tables, forms, navigation, and overlays
- Class Variance Authority for component variant management

**Data Processing**
- XLSX library for Excel file parsing and generation
- Support for .xlsx, .xls, and .csv file formats
- Bulk import with tag assignment capabilities

**File Upload**
- Multer middleware for handling multipart form data
- In-memory storage strategy for file processing
- Type definitions via `@types/multer`

**Development Environment**
- Replit-specific plugins for runtime error modals, cartographer, and dev banner
- Automatic WebSocket setup for Neon database in development
- Font loading from Google Fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono)

**Styling & Design**
- Tailwind CSS with PostCSS and Autoprefixer
- Custom color system with HSL color space
- Responsive design utilities
- Dark mode support via CSS variables
